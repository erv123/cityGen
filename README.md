# cityGen
Arucas script to generate cities

Based on City Generator by ProbableTrain https://github.com/ProbableTrain/MapGenerator

# Installation

1. Install latest version of essentialClient https://github.com/senseiwells/EssentialClient and make sure you have world edit (this was the easiest way to do some things so world edit is required)
2. Locate script folder (.minecraft\config\EssentialClient\Scripts)
3. Download all files into the script folder (2 of the libraries lineUtils and advanced math will be official libraries soon but until then they should be added manually)
4. Run the script from minecraft
